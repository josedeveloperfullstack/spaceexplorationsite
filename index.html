    <h3>55 Years Ago: The First Test Flight of the Apollo Lunar Module</h3>
    <p>The Grumman Aircraft Corporation in Bethpage, NY, built the Apollo Lunar Module (LM), the vehicle to take two astronauts down to the lunar surface and return them to the waiting Command Module in lunar orbit. Before NASA could declare the LM safe to fly astronauts, it required testing in Earth orbit without a crew. Grumman delivered the first flight unit, LM-1, to NASA’s Kennedy Space Center (KSC) in Florida in June 1967 where workers prepared it for flight. During the Jan. 22, 1968, flight of Apollo 5, LM-1 simulated the steps of a lunar landing mission, testing the engines of the descent stage, used to land the crew on the Moon, and the ascent stage, used to return them into lunar orbit.</p>
    <p>NASA managers had hoped to complete the first uncrewed test flight of the LM in the spring of 1967 and in preparation stacked the AS-206 Saturn IB rocket on Launch Pad 37B in January. Delays in the delivery of LM-1 to KSC and the disruption of all Apollo schedules in the wake of the Jan. 27 Apollo 1 fire led managers to alter these plans. The AS-204 rocket for Apollo 1 remained undamaged from the fire, and managers on March 20 announced that it would launch the Apollo 5 LM-1 mission. That required destacking AS-206 at LC-37B and placing it in long-term storage – it eventually flew in 1973 to launch the first crew to the Skylab space station. Meanwhile, workers destacked AS-204 at LC-34 on April 6, inspected it thoroughly, and restacked it at LC-37B, completing that activity on April 10. The LM-1 flight article arrived in KSC’s Manned Spacecraft Operations Building (MSOB) on June 23 but required significant work before managers declared it ready for flight. As a weight-saving measure, and because it was not planned to land anywhere, this spacecraft didn’t carry any landing legs. Workers in the MSOB completed the engineering work and placed LM-1 inside the Spacecraft LM Adapter (SLA). Instead of an Apollo Command and Service Module (CSM), they topped the SLA with a nine-foot tall aerodynamic cone since the Saturn IB rocket did not have sufficient thrust to place both a CSM and a LM into orbit. Workers at LC-37B stacked LM-1 inside the SLA atop the AS-204 rocket on Nov. 19 to begin prelaunch testing including a Countdown Demonstration Test completed on Jan. 19, 1968.</p>
